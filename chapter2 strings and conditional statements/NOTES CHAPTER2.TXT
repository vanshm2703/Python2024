1.string
->Data type stores series of characters
->escape secquence characters used for formating. eg- Tab nextline 
A->basic operators
    ->concatination  -> "hello"+ "world" = "helloworld"
    ->length of str ->  len(str)
    
B->indexing- means the charters get positions that starts with index 0 and to so on
   ->helps in access characters
   ->we can not do assignment using indexing eg. str[5]=10  this is not allowed

C->Slicing- Accessing parts of a string
  ->str[starting_idx : ending_idx] note-ending idx is not included
  ->mostly used in machine learning
  ->Slicing in python support negative indexing 

D->string functions
  ->str= "i am a coder"
  ->str.endsWith("er.")#returns true if string ends with substr
  ->str.capitalize()#capitalize first character
  ->str.replace(old,new) #replaces all occurences of old with new
  ->str.find(word) #returns 1st index of first occurences
  ->str.count("am") #counts the ocuurence of substr in string

E->Conditional Statements
  ->if-elif-else(syntax)
  ->eg. if(Condition):
           Statement1
        elif(Condition): #elif is else if
           Statement2
        else:
           StatementN
    ->difference between if and elif is that it will always check if Statement and elif only check if (if) Condition is not met
    ->indentation is important in python
