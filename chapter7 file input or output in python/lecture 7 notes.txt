1.File I/O
    ->python can be used to perform operations on file.
    ->ram volatile
    ->types of all files(they all bits in th system)
        ->1. Text Files: .txt , docx , .log etc
        ->2. Binary Files: .mp4 , .mov , .png , .jpeg etc.

1.A Open,read & close file
    ->we have to open a file before reading or writing
        ->f=open("file_name","mode") #mode can be read mode or write mode

   ->reading file
        ->data=f.read() #read entire file
        ->data=f.readline() #reads one line at a time
    
    ->writing to a File
        ->f=open("demo.txt","w") #write
          f.write("this is the new line") #overwrites the entire file
        ->f=open("demo.txt","a") #append (add at the end)
          f.write("this is a new line") #adds to the file

->with syntax 
    ->with open("E:\\python\\chapter7 file input or output in python\\demo.txt","r") as f:
        data=f.read()

->deleting a file
    ->using the os module
    ->Module(like a code library)is a file written by another programmer that generally has a Function we can use.
        import os
        os.remove(filename)
