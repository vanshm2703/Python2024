1.Loop IN python
    ->Used to repeat instruction
    ->types - while and for Loop
    ->while-jab tak

1.A Break and Continue
    ->Break: use to terminate the loop when encountered
    ->Continue: terminate execution in the current iteration & continue execution of the loop in second iteration

1.B For loop 
    ->used for sequential traversal.like list string tuples execution

            print(el)

1.C range()
    ->range number returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1(by default), and stops before a specified number
    range(start?,stop,step)
    ->eg for el in range(5)
            print(el)
        for el in range (1,5):
            print(el)
        for el in range(1,5,2):
            print(el)
1.D Pass statement
    ->pass is a null statement that does nothing. it is used as a placeholder for future code
    ->for el in range (10)
       pass
